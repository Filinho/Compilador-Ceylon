# Ceylon Compiler

This project is a college assignment for the Compilers course. The goal is to develop a simple compiler for the Ceylon language, covering the main stages of compilation.

## Project Overview
The compiler is organized in stages, each in its own folder:
- **Lab-01:** Lexical analysis (lexer/tokenizer)
- (Other labs may cover syntax analysis, semantic analysis, code generation, etc.)

## Structure
- `Lab-01/` — Lexical parser and related files

## How to Run (Lab-01 Example)
1. Enter the `Lab-01` folder.
2. Follow the instructions in `Lab-01/README.md` to generate and run the lexer.

## Example Input
You can use the file `Lab-01/compil-lab1-amostra-B-ivanderlei-mendes-silva-filho.ceylon` as a sample Ceylon source code for testing.
